                                With this portfolio being online, that seems like the appropriate salutation.
                                I am originally from Bronx, New York, but am currently a Georgia transplant living in the
                                Atlanta area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a graduate of Georgia Southern University and am an Electrical Engineer. 
                            In my spare time, I enjoy sports, music, and travel just to name a few.
                            Watching technology tutorials and looking up random information on Wikipedia
                             are also notable pastimes of mine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technology and innovation fuel me to excitement as I am always reading up on the latest
                            technologies, looking for the next best device, or thinking of ways to make everyday items or
                            processes better or more efficient.As you navigate through my portfolio, you will notice these themes incorporated in the various projects.
                            Each endeavor has a purpose to enhance or continue to push the bounds of technology, human thought and interaction,
                            and quality of processes.Thank you for stopping by and hopefully you will have an insightful experience.
